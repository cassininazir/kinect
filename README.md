self vs other
======
*an art installation using computer vision and human thought*

The Self vs Other installation incorporates submitted anonymous thoughts that are attached to participants through projection mapping. 

The thoughts are randomly assigned to participants from a collection stored in the websiteâ€™s database as they interact with the piece by walking through the mapped space.  

We were particularly inspired by the existential works of Sartre and Camus and their examination of the self vs the other -- specifically the influence that others have on the individual sense of identity.
